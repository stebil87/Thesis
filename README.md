# Thesis
Advancing Precision Agriculture: Machine Learning-based Early Detection of Potato Sprouting via Electrophysiological Signals

Last push:

- extended to all dataframes

- debugged anomaly detection

-  detrended wavelet linear and continous, plus keeped one dict with raw data

- featgen only with raw data, no windowing

- computed correlations wrt y
